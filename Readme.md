  Connect is an extensible HTTP server framework for [node](http://nodejs.org) using "plugins" known as _middleware_.

```js
var connect = require('connect');
var http = require('http');

var app = connect();

// gzip/deflate outgoing responses
var compression = require('compression');
app.use(compression());

// store session state in browser cookie
var cookieSession = require('cookie-session');
app.use(cookieSession({
    keys: ['secret1', 'secret2']
}));

// parse urlencoded request bodies into req.body
var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded());

// respond to all requests
app.use(function(req, res){
  res.end('Hello from Connect!\n');
});

//create node.js http server and listen on port
http.createServer(app).listen(3000);
```

## Getting Started

Connect is a simple framework to glue together various "middleware" to handle requests.

### Install Connect

```sh
$ npm install connect
```

### Create an app

The main component is a Connect "app". This will store all the middleware
added and is, itself, a function.

```js
var app = connect();
```

### Use middleware

The core of Connect is "using" middleware. Middleware are added as a "stack"
where incoming requests will execute each middleware one-by-one until a middleware
does not call `next()` within it.

```js
app.use(function middleware1(req, res, next) {
  // middleware 1
  next();
});
app.use(function middleware2(req, res, next) {
  // middleware 2
  next();
});
```

### Mount middleware

The `.use()` method also takes an optional path string that is matched against
the beginning of the incoming request URL. This allows for basic routing.

```js
app.use('/foo', function fooMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // req.url starts with "/foo"
  next();
});
app.use('/bar', function barMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // req.url starts with "/bar"
  next();
});
```

### Error middleware

There are special cases of "error-handling" middleware. There are middleware
where the function takes exactly 4 arguments. Errors that occur in the middleware
added before the error middleware will invoke this middleware when errors occur.

```js
app.use(function onerror(err, req, res, next) {
  // an error occurred!
});
```

### Create a server from the app

The last step is to actually use the Connect app in a server. The `.listen()` method
is a convenience to start a HTTP server.

```js
var server = app.listen(port);
```

The app itself is really just a function with three arguments, so it can also be handed
to `.createServer()` in Node.js.

```js
var server = http.createServer(app);
```

## Middleware

These middleware and libraries are officially supported by the Connect/Express team:

  - [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) - previous `bodyParser`, `json`, and `urlencoded`. You may also be interested in:
    - [body](https://github.com/raynos/body)
    - [co-body](https://github.com/visionmedia/co-body)
    - [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body)
  - [compression](https://github.com/expressjs/compression) - previously `compress`
  - [connect-timeout](https://github.com/expressjs/timeout) - previously `timeout`
  - [cookie-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-parser) - previously `cookieParser`
  - [cookie-session](https://github.com/expressjs/cookie-session) - previously `cookieSession`
  - [csurf](https://github.com/expressjs/csurf) - previously `csrf`
  - [errorhandler](https://github.com/expressjs/errorhandler) - previously `error-handler`
  - [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) - previously `session`
  - [method-override](https://github.com/expressjs/method-override) - previously `method-override`
  - [morgan](https://github.com/expressjs/morgan) - previously `logger`
  - [response-time](https://github.com/expressjs/response-time) - previously `response-time`
  - [serve-favicon](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-favicon) - previously `favicon`
  - [serve-index](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index) - previously `directory`
  - [serve-static](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-static) - previously `static`
  - [vhost](https://github.com/expressjs/vhost) - previously `vhost`

Most of these are exact ports of their Connect 2.x equivalents. The primary exception is `cookie-session`.

Some middleware previously included with Connect are no longer supported by the Connect/Express team, are replaced by an alternative module, or should be superseded by a better module. Use one of these alternatives instead:

  - `cookieParser`
    - [cookies](https://github.com/jed/cookies) and [keygrip](https://github.com/jed/keygrip)
  - `limit`
    - [raw-body](https://github.com/stream-utils/raw-body)
  - `multipart`
    - [connect-multiparty](https://github.com/superjoe30/connect-multiparty)
    - [connect-busboy](https://github.com/mscdex/connect-busboy)
  - `query`
    - [qs](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring)
  - `staticCache`
    - [st](https://github.com/isaacs/st)
    - [connect-static](https://github.com/andrewrk/connect-static)
