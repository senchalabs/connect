.SH "Description"
Connect is a dual purpose library, aiding in both rapid development, and deployment of node servers\. Connect \"middleware\" can be stacked to create a robust application within minutes\. The \fIconnect\fR executable supports launching of both regular \fBnet\.Server\fR, and \fBconnect\.Server\fR instances\.
.
.P
The connect executable supplies \fIinit\.d\fR friendly \fIstart\fR, \fIstop\fR, and \fIrestart\fR commands, and accept a direct path to the module meant to be run, otherwise defaults to trying both \fIapp\.js\fR and \fIserver\.js\fR in the current working directory\.
.
.P
Also to check the status of a process you may use the \fIstatus\fR command, which checks if the process is running\.
.

.SH "Supported Environment Variables"
Currently the following environment variables may be set via the \fB\-\-ENV VAL\fR catchall\. For example we can alter the log format used via the command line with `connect \-\-logFormat \":method :uri\"\.
.
.P
Boolean values may use strings such as \fIyes\fR, \fIno\fR, \fItrue\fR, \fIfalse\fR\.

.SH "Middleware"
Connect middleware is divided into two concepts\. First we have \fIfilters\fR which perform an action and allow lower middleware to respond to the request, secondly we have \fIproviders\fR which are conceptual \"end\-points\", responding to the request without continuing down the stack\.
.
.SH "Middleware Usage"
Below is an example which shows usage of the \fIlog\fR filter bundled with Connect, as well as the \fIstatic\fR provider\.
.
.P
The keys \fBfilter\fR and \fBprovider\fR are used only as short\-cuts to bundled middleware, to utilize a custom module we can assign a module\'s exports to the \fBmodule\fR key\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

module\.exports = require(\'\./lib/connect\')\.createServer([
    { filter: \'log\' },
    { module: require(\'path/to/custom/middleware\') },
    { provider: \'static\', root: __dirname + \'/public\' }
]);
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
As shown above the module exports a \fBconnect\.Server\fR and does not call the \fBlisten()\fR method directly\. This allows other modules to \"mount\" this app, as well as allowing the \fIconnect\fR executable to control how the server is run\.
.
.P
If you prefer not to use \fIconnect\fR, you can simply create a script executable by \fInode\fR, \fBrequire()\fR the app, then invoke \fBlisten()\fR\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

#!/usr/bin/env node
require(\'\./app\')\.listen();

.
.SH "Middleware Authoring"
Middleware is essentially just an object, responding to a \fBhandle()\fR method, the example below illustrates how simple it is to create, and utilize custom middleware\.
.
.P
First we define the \fBhandle()\fR method, which accepts three arguments, \fIreq\fR, \fIres\fR, and \fInext\fR\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

var helloWorld = {
    handle: function(req, res, next){
        res\.writeHead(200, { \'Content\-Type: \'text/plain\' });
        res\.end(\'Hello World\');
    }
};

require(\'connect\')\.createServer([
    { module: helloWorld }
]);
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fBnext()\fR function passes control to the next middleware layer in the stack, and may optionally be passed an instanceof \fBError\fR, at which time only \fBhandleError()\fR methods may respond\.
.
.P
If you wish to pass an exception down the stack, you can invoke \fBnext()\fR like below:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

 if (someRequirementIsNotMet) {
     next(new Error(\'my requirement was not met!\'));
 }
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
We can take this example further by \"exporting\" the \fBhandle()\fR method, so that other libraries can simply \fBrequire(\'hello\-world\')\fR:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

# hello\-world\.js
exports\.handle = function(req, res, next){
    res\.writeHead(200, { \'Content\-Type: \'text/plain\' });
    res\.end(\'Hello World\');
};

# app\.js
require(\'connect\')\.createServer([
    { module: require(\'\./hello\-world\') }
]);
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Exception Handling"
If an exception was thrown, or is passed to \fBnext()\fR, middleware may define the \fBhandleError()\fR method in order to respond (or ignore) the exception\. The \fBhandleError()\fR method follows the same semantics as \fBhandle()\fR, for example:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

exports\.handleError = function(err, req, res, next){
    // At any time we can call next() without
    // any arguments to eliminate exceptional status and
    // continue down the stack

    if (err\.code === process\.ENOENT) {
        // We dont want to deal with missing files
        // so pass the exception
        next(err);
    } else {
        // Respond with a message
        res\.writeHead(200, { \'Content\-Type\': \'text/plain\' })
        res\.end(\'shit! im broken\');
    }
};
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "Setup Configuration"
Connect also supports the \fBsetup()\fR method, which is called when the middleware is stacked, and is passed the environment\. For example lets say we want our \fIlog\fR middleware to support a custom format, we might define \fBsetup()\fR as shown below:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

var log = {};

log\.setup = function(env) {
    this\.format = this\.format || \'our default format\';
}
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Allowing developers to pass a custom format when stacked:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

connect\.createServer([
    { module: log, format: \'custom log format\' }
]);
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
In some cases we may want to support changes through the environment as well\. For example we may want to support \fBconnect \-\-logFormat \"super cool format\"\fR, to do all we need to do is check for \fBenv\.logFormat\fR as shown below\. The precedence given is up to you, however the env is recommended\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

log\.setup = function(env) {
    this\.format = env\.logFormat || this\.format || \'our default format\';
}
.
.fi
